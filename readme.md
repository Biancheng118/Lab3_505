# IMTC 505 - Lab 3 Assignment

<b>Team Name:</b> Deranged Penguins 

<b>Team Members:</b> Brian Bian, Jonathan Gresl, Touba Sheikhshab

## How the project was made
After brainstorming various ideas, our group decided to build something related to the theme of our project – the deranged penguin. Touba took pictures of some relatable book covers so that they could be used as image targets. As Brian plans to work on the AR adaptation of the project, he took the lead in creating the AR visuals for the assignment. He implemented image recognition using Vuforia and then linked events to each of them. The concept is simple; when the device camera is pointed at a recognizable object, additional content is visible on the device display in a location relevant to the recognized image. In this case, a 3D penguin model (from rigmodels.com) appears above the book to give the illusion that the penguin is reading the book. Along with the penguin is some text that gives the illusion that the penguin is saying something about the book. The AR visuals for the first image target are re-used for the second and third image target - with different text to show that each book cover is recognized uniquely.

## The story
A very smart penguin can read books. As he finishes each book, he expresses his excitement, interest, and concern. The first book that he reads excites him because it tells stories about fellow penguins and their adorable antics in remote and icy locations. The second book interests him because it focuses on the differences between nations (or penguin colonies) and how they develop differently – resulting in success or failure. The third book is very concerning to the penguin because it discusses some disturbing human crimes.

    Below are the penguin's thoughts as they are shown in the AR environment: 

    - Penguins in the Wild 
        - “I want to explore” 

    - Why Nations Fail 
        - “I am telling this to my colony” 

    - Criminology 
        - “Wow... humans are so deranged! I’m going back”
